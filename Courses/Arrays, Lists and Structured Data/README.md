# Java Programming : Arrays, Lists and Structured Data
    by Duke University (Coursera)
    
## About this Course
Build on the software engineering skills you learned in “Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software” by learning new data structures. Use these data structures to build more complex programs that use Java’s object-oriented features. At the end of the course you will write an encryption program and a program to break your encryption algorithm.

## After completing this course you will be able to
* Read and write data from/to files;
* Solve problems involving data files;
* Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages); 
* Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList;
* Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems;
* Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.

## Important Note
Some code could be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. You can get the IDE from the University website [here](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course3/index.php).
